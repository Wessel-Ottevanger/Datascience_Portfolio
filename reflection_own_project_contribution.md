# Reflection on personal project contribution

## Situation

For the minor applied data science on The Hague University of Applied Sciences I was assigned to the group that had to do an assignment for TNO, a company specialized in research in multiple fields. Our assignment was to create a text classifier that could classify dark web text content using topics Interpol is interested in.

## Task

During the minor we used SCRUM as our development method, because of this we mostly worked on tasks individually. In the first few weeks of the project we mainly researched existing machine learning methods to gain domain knowledge to create our own machine learning strategies. After we created our own strategies each of our group members started researching and experimenting with different methods to realise our strategies. First I researched LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) and after I experimented with K-means clustering and Ensemble learning.

## Action

To gain knowledge about how LSH works I did some Literature research and read the information that was available online, which wasn’t that much. After my research I tried to vectorize and visualize the data using LSH and TSNE. After experimenting with LSH I researched K-means clustering and nearing the end of our project I mainly focused on Ensemble learning.

## Result

When visualizing the vectors I created using the LSH method I realised this method is not usable for our project because it didn’t create vectors a machine learning model would be able to accurately predict. The reason this did not work as well as we hoped was unclear since it isn’t a widely used method and there is not a lot to find about this method online, because it was quite hard to get it to work and it took a lot of time we abandoned this method and focused on other methods.
The results of K-means clustering were usable but later in the project we decided to focus on supervised learning methods because those methods better suited our needs. The results of the Ensemble learning were better than anything I tried before, they were about as good as Linear SVC, which gave us the best results for our data. 

## Reflection

The two methods I researched for this project both were not used in the end but I am still satisfied with the results since researching and experimenting with these methods helped me understand the general concept of machine learning.
If I encounter a similar situation in the future I would try to research easier methods first instead of diving in a subject that is not very well documented and quite hard to understand.
