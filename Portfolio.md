## Research project

### Task definition
In this project I mostly constributed to the following research questions:

##### What labels of the dataset provided by TNO are relevant for the research?
It was concluded that all labels were relevant but were not in the correct format, I have created a [script to map the Agora and Web-IQ dataset labels to interpol topics. ](./Notebooks/maptointerpoltopics.ipynb) 

##### What feature extraction methods are available for text classification?
For this project I have used methods like Word2Vec and Fasttext to extract features and vectorize our text data.

##### What machine learning algorithms can be used for natural language processing?
There are various machine learning algorithms that can be used for natural language processing, in [this script ](./Notebooks/Ensemble_Learning.ipynb) I have used 6 different machine learning momdels, 6 different ways to vectorize text data and 5 different preprocessing methods.

##### What machine learning algorithms give the best result?
The best results I have achieved this project was with my Ensemble learning model, which scored around 95% accuracy on the Agora dataset.

##### What combination of processing, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms gives the best pipeline?
The best possible pipline that was created during this project was with minimal preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization and a Linear SVC model.
