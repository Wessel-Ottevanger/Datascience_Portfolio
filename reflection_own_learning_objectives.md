# Reflection on own learning objectives

## Situation

For the minor applied data science on The Hague University of Applied Sciences I was assigned to the group that had to do an assignment for TNO, a company specialized in research in multiple fields. Our assignment was to create a text classifier that could classify dark web text content using topics Interpol is interested in. During the minor my learning objectives were gaining experience in the python programming language gaining knowledge about the general concept of data science, machine learning and natural language processing.

## Task

To realise these learning objectives my tasks were to research LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing), K-means clustering and Ensemble learning. Besides from realising my learning objectives with researching machine learning and vectorization methods I also attended the lectures and did the data camp assignments. 

## Action

To research the chosen machine learning and vectorization methods I mainly used literature research as research method, most of my information came from the internet and published papers. To learn about natural language processing I also did some literature research but most of my information comes from experimenting with different techniques and comparing the results of these different techniques.

## Result

The results of my literature research are the knowledge I gained and used to create my own machine learning pipelines. Experimenting with different techniques used in the field of natural processing resulted in gaining domain knowledge and the creation of multiple python scripts to classify dark web text content. The best results I had with the scripts I created was a precision recall and accuracy of about 95%, while this is quite a high score it is not fully accurate since our dataset was highly biased towards drugs, which was visible in the results.

## Reflection

At first researching the different machine learning and vectorization methods was quite hard, but after gaining more domain knowledge by attending lectures and reading papers and other articles it became easier. Although I am content with the results of my research and created scripts, the next time I encounter a problem like this I would start with easier examples and work my way up to harder methods instead of starting out on more advanced methods.
I am also happy with the experience and knowledge I gained during this minor because it is applicable in a lot of fields and valuable experience to mention on my resume.
