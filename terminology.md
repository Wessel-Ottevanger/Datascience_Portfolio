|  Natural Language Processing | A subject within the field of computer science which is used to analyze and use often large amounts of linguistical data. |
| Preprocessing  | Preprocessing is to process data before it is used. In this project we have used preprocessing to make the data more uniform and usable. |
|Vectorization|Vectorizaion is creating vectors of numbers from text data.|
|Machine learning|Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.|
|overfitting|the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably|
|underfitting|the production of an analysis that corresponds too loosely to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to predict future observations reliably|
|Pipeline|A set of tasks performed in a certain order to create a greater objective|
